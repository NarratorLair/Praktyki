					<p>Prof Jacoby has been a consultant since 1980: between 1983 and 1993 at the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospitals in London; and since 1994 in Oxford as Clinical Reader and later Professor of Old Age Psychiatry. His research in the field of old age psychiatry enjoys an international reputation.</p>
					<p>He was the lead editor of <em>the Oxford Textbook of Old Age Psychiatry</em> published by Oxford University Press, first to fourth editions (called <em>Psychiatry in the Elderly</em> in editions 1-3). In all four editions he co-wrote the chapter on testamentary capacity. He also contributed to chapter 13, Testamentary Capacity in Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks: <em>Executors, Administrators and Probate.</em> (eds. J.H.G. Sunnucks with J.G. Ross Martyn & N. Caddick). Sweet & Maxwell, London. He lectures to lawyers and doctors on testamentary capacity. He is co-author, with solicitor Peter Steer, of <a href="pdf/PublishedBMJArticle.pdf"><em>How to assess capacity to make a will</em> published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> 2007, 335, 155-157</a>, and of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Testamentary-Capacity-Law-Practice-Medicine/dp/0198727526"><em>Testamentary Capacity: Law, Practice and Medicine</em> (with Martyn Frost & Stephen Lawson)</a>.</p> 
					
					<p>Prof Jacoby speaks fluent French, German and Russian.</p>
					<p>Prof Jacoby has written very many reports for solicitors in criminal cases, including 31 cases of homicide. In the last 20 years or so he has developed a particular interest in mental capacity in older people, in particular testamentary capacity. He has given opinions in over 300 hundred capacity cases of which the great majority were contentious probate, and given evidence in those that were not settled out of court. He has conducted “golden rule” assessments of potential testators, and assessments of older persons in cases where disability in relation to trial (fitness to plead) has been raised. He has published chapters and articles in the area of testamentary capacity, and given lectures on the medical aspects of capacity assessment to seminars run by various barristers’ chambers, solicitors’ firms and, in 2007, to the Chancery Bar Association.</p>
